* proof, part 2: sigma is well-defined

* wirtinger presentation
* do wirtinger for trefoil and show you get the same group
* show that that group is different than the group of the unknot
* introduce fundemental groups, induced homomorphisms
* introduce generators and relations, free products of groups
* maybe introduce free products with the universal mapping property to help
